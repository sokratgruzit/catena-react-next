            CORE is calling all bug bounty hunters to identify bugs in the CORE Framework. We invite our community and
            all professional bug hunters to investigate and responsibly report findings to us. The rewards will range
            from an equivalent of 10 â€“ 1000 USDT, with an increase according to the submission quality and seriousness
            of the identified threat. In the case of many hackers finding the same bug, the first to submit earns the
            reward.
